# Project Overview

This project is a minimal web application that serves as a starting point for building interactive websites. While the main functionality has not yet been defined (as the `index.html` file does not contain any content), this template is designed to be easily expandable and customizable based on your needs.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps to clone the repository and set it up on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser to view the project. Since no additional files are present in this initial setup, further configuration may be required as more features are added.

## Usage

1. After cloning the project, you can open `index.html` directly in any modern web browser.
2. Begin modifying the `index.html` file to suit your needs. You can add HTML content, CSS styles, and JavaScript functionality to enhance your web application.

## Features

- Clean and simple structure for easy customization and development.
- Responsive layout that can be adjusted for various screen sizes (pending additional styles).
- Room for expansion to include JavaScript frameworks, additional HTML pages, or external libraries as needed.

## Dependencies

As the project currently stands, there are no specific dependencies listed in a `package.json` file. Once you start incorporating libraries or frameworks, be sure to include them in a new or existing `package.json` file for version management.

## Project Structure

```
/<project-directory>
 └── index.html  # Main HTML file for the web application
```

This project structure is minimal and designed for easy expansion. Feel free to create additional folders for CSS, JavaScript, or asset files as needed.
